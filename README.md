# Koin-for-SDK-Developers
Final source code demo used for the Youtube Video 
- In this video, I will teach you how to use Koin DI (Dependency Injection) in a module or for your SDK's without the need of creating a custom application context or the need to include the library in your application.
Perfect for those who are SDK developers, or working with modules looking to have separate dependency injection.
